FIRST EXPERIMENT

For the first experiment I did the following things:
1.Used seed for reproducibility
2.Using early stopping during training
3.Added a learning rate scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau
4.USED ADAM OPTIMIZER, to see how predictions improve
5.Did minimal data augmentation: Used mirroring

Best score for the first experiment: 0.64750
Running time: 20 mins 20 sec
Notebook version: “Exp should be 0.647” https://www.kaggle.com/code/theca3sar/homework-2?scriptVersionId=271362678

SECOND EXPERIMENT

For the second experiment I did the following things:
1.Added these data augmentation techniques: RandomCrop,RandomHorizontalFlip,RandomAffine,ColorJitter
2. Because the Adam optimizer improved my score in the first experiment, I decided to keep it for the second experiment to see how data augmentation changes my results.
3.Changed LRScheduler to CosineAnnealing
4.Smoothed labels
5.Added epochs

Best score for the second experiment: 0.628
Running time: 1 hour 56 mins

THIRD EXPERIMENT

For the third experiment I did the following things:
1. I used CutMix and Mixup 
2. I kept the rest of the configuration the same as in experiment 2

Best score for the third experiment: 0.673
Running time for the training loop: 49 minutes and 53 seconds

FOURTH EXPERIMENT

For the fourth experiment I did the following things:
1.Used the data augmentation that i Had in the first experiment (light data augmentation)
2.Used cutmix and mixup
3.Left the same optimizer.
(Same configuration as experiment three BUT different data augmentation)

Best score for the fourth experiment: 
Running time for the training loop:
